We can style an element in three ways by 
INLINE STYLING - ON ELEMENT OF ANY TYPE
INTERNAL STYLING - IS DONE BY CREATING STYLE TAG IN HEAD 
EXTERNAL STYLING - BY CREATING NEW CSS FILE AND LINKNG IT TO INDEX.HTML
................................................................................
BOX MODEL - IS USED ON EVERY HTML ELEMENTS.
PADDING - TO ADD EXTRA AREA (FOR or AROUND) THE CONTENT.
BORDER - AFTER PADDING YOU CAN CREATE BORDER FOR YOUR CONTENT(there are differnt types of border)
MARGIN - FOR CREATING SPACE BETWEEN 2 ELEMENTS FOR Eg - DIV1 AND DIV2
..............................................................................................
HEIGHT N OVER FLOW
overflow css google.

if there is'nt any content.  (HEIGHT = EMPTY)
if there is content .(HEIGHT = CONTENT SIZE)
if the height IS DEFINED while styling and the CONTENT Size is LARGER than defined height. 
    *(CONTENT will OVERFLOW)* 
    SOLUTION FOR OVERFLOW - overflow : visible,hidden 
                            overflow : scroll //for scrollbar on both end
                            overflow : auto //for vertical scroll bar
