first we did static structuring
    then gave some styling
    created boxes and created tickets and then
    made tickets creation dynamic
    after that added unique id code in another file -> uuid.js 
    after that changed header colors of tickets
    gave background color for clicking color boxes & sorting tickets according to the color of tickets.
    after that gave lock and unlock feature 
    // when unlocked - u can create delete and edit but u cannot sort according to   colors
                    // when clicked on unlocked all Tasks will show
// when locked -> u cannot create new task but sort(filter) according to colors

added delete eventlistener in createTicket and deleting ticket after ticket creation

arranging code in different files
