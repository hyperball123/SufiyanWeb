<!-- put the static html as an innerhtml for containing element in js and internal element -> shortcut (innerHTML) -->

flex ->height , width (if not works) then : use min-height , min-width
Eg - min-height: 80vh;
 ## /* AT LEAST THIS MUCH HEIGHT IS NEEDED FOR THE ELEMENT AND IF ELEMENT INCREASES HEIGHT ALSO INCREASES for the page */
--------------------
line-height: 145%;
 /* line height is the space between lines */
    letter-spacing: 1px;
  /* add space between letters */
  ##
  ---------------------------------
  ## 
  <!-- whichever script is written 
            last can access function of the scripts that is written above it 
            HERE , script.js can access uuid functions-->
##
---------------------------------------------------
##
 flex -> wrap -> if all the elements width is more than the given width
         of the parent then wrap will put the extra elements in the next line
------------------------------------------------------------
##
  display: none;

  display : none -> element will disappear as weel as it woont take space
